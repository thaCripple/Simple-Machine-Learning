# My trial implementation of the Stacking Classifier from the sklearn library on the Wine Classification dataset.
The Implementation inlcudes:
- Simple Dimensionality Reduction with a Random Forest Classifier
- Histogram Gradient Boosted Trees Classifier
- Support Vector Machine Classifier as part of a Grid Search Cross Validation Pipeline

There is a performance comparison between the individual classifiers and the ensamble
